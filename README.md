# Uncommon Javascript Bug: Unexpected Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to null handling. The `foo` function aims to add two numbers, but its null handling is incomplete.  The provided solution addresses this by explicitly checking for both null values.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive null checks in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior.
